# OpenCV-APCSP_Project
#APCSP project, in 2023 game charged up, I want to have the ability
#to detect objects on the field, and automatically drive towards it using opencv.
#this will lessen the pain of the driver trying to articulate where it is
#especially considering that the view is blocked by the robot.
